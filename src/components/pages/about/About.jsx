            <strong>ABOUT ME</strong>

            I consider myself a sociable person, who likes to work in a team but
            I can also adapt to individual tasks. When I think about the near
            future from a professional point of view, I want to work on a part
            time job as a Front-end Developer, because I had the opportunity to
            develop in this field in the last year and I don't want to stop
            here. My long-term goal is to learn as many new things as possible
            in other areas too. As for me, I like to read, travel and I hope to
            discover as many new places in the future.
